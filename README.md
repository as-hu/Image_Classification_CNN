# Image_Classification_CNN
Image classifier build using Tensorflow
Convolution Neural Network is good for Image Classification because in this type of Neural netwok a particular Neuron of a particular is Connected to the small portion of the layer before it.

The Entire Process consist of some steps->
1. The Image is converted into a 3D matrix.
2. Then we will pass the matrix through different layers.
3. Basically There are 4 layers- convolution Layer, Relu layer ,pooling layer,fully connected layer.
